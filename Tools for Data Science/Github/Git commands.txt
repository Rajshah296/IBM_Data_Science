Git commands to start working with creating and managing your code branches, including:

1) create a new local repository using git init

2) create and add a file to the repo using git add <filename>
   Note:- This command sends changes to staging area. If you want to send all the changes to the staging area, then use * instead of filename.

3) commit changes using git commit
    Note:- commit requires a message along with it. You can give that message by writing -m  <message>

4) create a branch using git branch <branchname>

5) switch to a branch using git checkout <branchname>

6) check the status of files changed using git status

7) review recent commits using git log

8) revert changes using git revert <COMMIT ID>
    Note:- If you don't know the commit id, then you can use HEAD option. HEAD will revert the last commit made.
     
8) get a list of branches and active branch using git branch

9) merge changes in your active branch into another branch using git merge <branchname>
